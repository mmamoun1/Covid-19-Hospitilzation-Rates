Data Source: https://healthdata.gov/dataset/COVID-19-Reported-Patient-Impact-and-Hospital-Capa/6xf2-c3ie
The data comes from the healthdata.gov website, and was published by the	U.S. Department of Health & Human Services.

This repository provides code describing the process and reason for subsetting the "COVID-19 Reported Patient Impact and Hospital Capacity by State" dataset for specialized analysis. The purpose of the original dataset is to provide information about COVID-19 in hospitals on a state-wide level. So, it contains information such as: the number of COVID-19 patients, the number of available patient beds, the number of hospitals in the given state expecting a staffing shortage within the week, and more. Also, this information is updated every friday to give new insights into the hospital's statuses. 

The subsetted dataset is useful because while the original dataset has a lot of valuable information, the amount of information can make it hard to find the most pressing issues. So, the new dataset contains the 10 states with the most anticipated critical staffing shortages within the week, which changes with the update of the original set. This way, focus can be put on those states who require the most assistance that week, and future analysis can also be done on that state's hospital information to find out why these shortages occurred and predict them occurring again.

Users can get started with this repository by first familiarizing themselves with the data, either from the link in the readme, or the link in the code. In doing this, users can understand the meaning of the data, making it easier to follow along and understand the coding process and the reason behind it. Then, users can inspect my written code from the "Unit3Final_MostafaMamoun.ipynb" file. They should first read through the code and the comments to make sure they understand the process, and then they can open it in their colab and try it out for themselves. 

This repository was inspired by a school project at the University of North Carolina Project in the class English 105.
