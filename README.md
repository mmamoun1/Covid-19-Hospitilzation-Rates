This repository provides code describing the process and reason for subsetting the "COVID-19 Reported Patient Impact and Hospital Capacity by State" dataset for specialized analysis. This subsetted dataset is useful because while the original dataset has a lot of valuable information about the number of hospitals in each state that are being affected by COVID-19, the amount of information can make it hard to find the most pressing issues. So, the new dataset contains the 10 states with the most anticipated critical staffing shortages within the week. This way, focus can be put on those states who require the most assistance, and future analysis can also be done on that state's hospital information to find out why these shortages occurred and predict them occurring again.
